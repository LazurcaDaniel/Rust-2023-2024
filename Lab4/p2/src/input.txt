McDonald's has condemned what it called disinformation over the Israel-Gaza war after boxes of live mice were released in three of its restaurants in apparent protests.

A video on social media showed customers at Birmingham's Star City restaurant jumping in shock as mice dyed in the colours of the Palestinian flag scurried near their feet on Monday.

A second clip showed mice in a box in the Perry Barr branch.

West Midlands Police has launched an investigation into the first case.

The fast food giant said both stores were temporarily closed for a full clean and visits from pest control officers.

Police said they were treating the first incident, an apparent protest against the Israel-Gaza war, as a public nuisance offence.
